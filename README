This is a control panel app for the rest of bscms.
It uses some ideas borrowed from django.contrib.admin to dynamically
create and admin/control panel interface.

In bscontrolpanel views are registered with the control panel rather than models
like in contrib.admin.  This allows streamlined views to be built for different
bits of functionality rather than the lower level, more direct interface of
contrib.admin
